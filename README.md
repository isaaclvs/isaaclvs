# Hi, I'm Isaac Alves 🇧🇷

A Brazilian Software Engineer focused on backend development, passionate about clean APIs, automation, and building systems that last. I specialize in Ruby on Rails and enjoy working with legacy code, scalable infrastructure, and well-tested codebases.

🛠️ **Experienced with:**  
Ruby · Rails · PostgreSQL · Sidekiq · Docker · Kubernetes · GitHub Actions · Redis · Tailwind CSS

🚀 **Currently working with:**  
Rails 4.2 on legacy systems, CI/CD, and containerized environments using Docker and K8s.

📍 **Based in:** Brazil (working remotely)  
📚 **Currently exploring:** Hotwire, Linux, and backend architecture patterns

🧠 **A bit about my journey:**  
I started in infrastructure and automation, migrated into web development with Ruby, and today I build APIs, work with production systems, and support real users. I'm now aiming for international remote opportunities where I can grow, contribute, and solve meaningful problems.
